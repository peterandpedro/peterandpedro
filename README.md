- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @peterandpedro, I am a boomer, as a young man I studied computer science, in high school. 
- ğŸ‘€ Now I understand that my path is computer science and I am starting to study the various types of programming languages. 
- ğŸŒ± Maybe it's too late to enter the field of computer science? I don't know... but I'm trying with all my might!
